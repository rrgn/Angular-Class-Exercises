Instructor Toby used to work at a super market as a cashier. His work experience there has made him an expert in making change.

Write an app to make the change needed - in quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies - given the bill amount, and the given amount.

The app should have

1. A number input to enter the bill amount.
2. A number input to enter the given amount.
3. A "Make change!" button
4. When the "Make change!" button is clicked, it should display the number of coins for each coin type that are needed. For example:

  * 4 quarters
  * 3 dimes
  * 0 nickels
  * 2 pennies

5. Bonus, display the coin image next to the number
5. Extra super bonus: write this same app using jQuery or nothing but the DOM native API. Compare and contrast.
