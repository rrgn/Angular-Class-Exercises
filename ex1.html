      <label>Hello, {{name}},!</label><br>
      <label>Length of your name is: {{name.length}}!</label

<!--
Hints: look at angular-examples/1-hello-world.html for the structure. You can use the `.length` property to get the number
of characters in a string. It even works in an AngularJS expression: `{{name.length}}`.
